"""On-demand downscaled image variants for media served over ``/static``.

The canvas UI renders full-resolution originals into tiny boxes — a node's
generation-history strip paints 5504x3072 PNGs into 56x56 thumbnails. The
bytes are only half the problem: even over localhost, where transfer is
free, nine such images cost ~2.1s of main-thread decode + raster in the
browser and drop seven frames. Serving a pre-shrunk variant removes that
work entirely (measured: 105.4MB -> 0.23MB, 2156ms of long tasks -> 0).

The cache is addressed purely by source path::

    <project_dir>/_thumbs/<variant>/<path relative to project_dir>.webp

so nothing about it leaks into a data schema. History records and canvas
JSON keep storing the original URL; callers opt in per render by asking for
a variant. Only newly appended history records proactively create one.
Freshness uses write ordering: a generated variant is stamped with its source's
mtime when the filesystem preserves ``os.utime``; object-store FUSE mounts may
instead give it the later upload time. In both cases ``thumb.mtime >=
source.mtime`` means current, while rewriting the source moves its mtime past
the existing thumbnail and invalidates it.

Building and serving are deliberately separate. ``fresh_thumbnail`` is what a
request calls and it never builds or queues work; ``ensure_thumbnail`` builds
and only ever runs in the background after a new history record is written (or
from the explicit offline backfill tool). A missing variant falls back to the
original without making an old project warm itself on read.

Every failure path returns ``None`` so the caller falls back to the
original. A slow node beats a broken one.
