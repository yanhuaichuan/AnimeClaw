"""Project-level asset builds for structured_v1 projects.

Each build reads the imported source text and publishes to SQLite.  None of them
touch Cognee, an embedding model or the graph.

The three builds differ in how much they can usefully do up front:

* **Characters** are worth discovering across the whole work, for both formats.
* **Scenes** are worth discovering up front only for screenplays, where scene
  headings already name every location.  Narrated projects have no comparable
  marker, so their scenes accumulate per episode instead.
* **Props** are never worth a full-text sweep.  What matters is which objects
  carry story weight in a given episode, which is a per-episode judgement.
