"""Character extraction straight from source text, without a knowledge graph.

The legacy path asks Cognee for graph context and lets a model name whoever it
finds there.  Structured extraction inverts that: the model only reports what a
specific span of text supports, and every candidate it returns must quote the
span it came from.  A quote that is not in the chunk is dropped, and a name the
imported source never writes is dropped, so a name invented outright has no
route into the character table.

What that does *not* establish is that the right quote was attached to the
right name.  A model can pair a real name with a real sentence about someone
else, and no check here can tell; the guards bound what may enter, not who a
line is about.  Attribution is left to the conservative merging below and to
whoever reads the result.

Merging is deliberately conservative.  A character's name is simultaneously a
SQLite primary key, a REST identifier and an asset directory name, so a wrong
merge is expensive to undo and a wrong split is cheap.  Rules therefore only
merge what the text states outright, and anything genuinely ambiguous is left
as separate candidates rather than guessed at.

# Extraction and appearance are two different contracts, deliberately kept
# apart.  Extraction is evidence-bound: every field it reports has to appear
# verbatim in the span it came from, which is what stops an invented character
# from entering the table.  A face prompt, a role, a build and an age band are
# none of them quotable — a screenplay writes "郑家悦" and what she does, not
# what her jaw looks like — so folding them into CharacterCandidate would mean
# relaxing the very guard that makes extraction trustworthy.
#
# So this stage runs after the cast is settled, takes only names that already
# survived verification, and is allowed to write what the source implies rather
# than what it states.  It is the half of legacy's CharacterEnrichment that
# structured extraction never carried over; scenes have had their equivalent
# since the beginning (``enrich_scene_environments_batched``), which is why
# scene builds produce usable prompts and character builds did not.
