"""Payload projection: pin a task's project-state inputs at enqueue time.

Some task runners read project state (database rows, project config values)
while they execute.  That makes the result depend on whatever the state happens
to be when the worker gets around to the task, and it requires the worker to be
able to reach that state at all.  Both properties are fine for the default
inline backend, where enqueue and execution happen in the same process on the
same machine, and neither is guaranteed for a non-inline task backend.

This module moves those reads forward: the enqueue side collects the values a
task will need and stores them inside the task payload, so the payload is a
self-contained description of the work.  Byte-sized inputs (images, audio,
canvas JSON) are *not* projected -- they live under ``OUTPUT_DIR`` and travel by
path.  Only database rows and project-config scalars are projected.

Shape -- a nested envelope inside ``payload``, never a new top-level field::

    payload["projection"] = {
        "projection_version": 1,
        "task_type": "...",
        "fields": {...},
    }

``payload``内部没有 schema：签名只覆盖实际内容（``envelope.py:149-160``
``_canonical_json``），不覆盖期望字段集，所以往 ``payload`` 里加嵌套字段天生不破坏
签名验证。

Evolution rules (keep these; they are what makes rolling upgrades possible):

* **Add a field** -- do not bump ``projection_version``.  Producer ships first,
  consumer reads later with ``.get()``.  Never validate the projection with an
  exact field set (``envelope.py:110-113`` ``_require_exact_fields`` is for the
  envelope, not for this); unknown fields must be ignored.
* **Remove a field** -- consumer stops reading first, and only the *next*
  release lets the producer stop sending it.  The other order breaks.
* **Change a field's meaning** -- never in place.  Either use a new key, or bump
  ``projection_version`` and let the consumer accept ``{N, N+1}`` for one
  release before narrowing back.

A missing required field always raises.  There is deliberately no "fall back to
reading the database" branch: that would hide the very defect this projection
exists to make visible.  Rolling back means not installing a projector at all
(see ``novelvideo.ports.projection``), which leaves the payload byte-for-byte
identical to one built without this module.
