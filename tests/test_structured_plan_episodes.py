"""Chapter mapping has to work on the store each track actually opens.

structured_v1 builds and planning open a SQLiteStore directly — they have no
graph to reach through the Cognee facade for. Chapter mapping is deterministic
and touches no graph, but it lived on CogneeStore, so the plan-episodes runner
raised AttributeError for every structured project. Nothing caught it because
the tests drove the store classes rather than the runner's own store loading.
