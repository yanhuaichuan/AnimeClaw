    Building it means dropping every novelvideo.api.* module so the rebuilt app

    block: any test collected earlier holds functions whose globals belong to
    the modules dropped here, and leaving the replacements behind turns those
    references into orphans.

    Restoring sys.modules is only half of it. Importing a submodule also binds
    it as an attribute of its parent package, and the rebuild rebinds
    novelvideo.api on novelvideo itself. A dotted patch target is resolved by
    walking those attributes rather than by reading sys.modules, so restoring
    one without the other leaves a patch landing on a module nobody is running.

    Everything after the first change to sys.modules sits inside try, because a
    failure while building the app would otherwise leave the process in exactly
    the state this exists to prevent.
