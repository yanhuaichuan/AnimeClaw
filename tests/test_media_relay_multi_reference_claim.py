"""Each relayed object must claim its own durable egress operation.

The ledger keys an operation by {org, project, root_task, business_task,
capability} and deliberately leaves request_digest out, so that the same key
arriving with a different payload is reported as a conflict rather than
silently becoming a second operation. That is the same contract Stripe states
for idempotency keys, and it means the caller owes the ledger one key per side
effect. Relaying N reference images under a single key breaks that side of the
bargain, and the ledger correctly refuses the second image.

The double this uses models the claim verdict an EgressOperationPort
implementation is required to return, rather than a fixed verdict, because a
stateless double cannot express the very behaviour under test. It lives in
tests/support/egress_ledger.py because the same contract is under test from a
second direction in tests/test_p0g4e_cognee_concurrent_egress.py.
