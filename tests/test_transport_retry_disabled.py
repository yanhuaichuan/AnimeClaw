"""Nobody re-sends a model request from inside this process.

Four facts, verified against the relayclaw gateway source and against 24h of
its production logs, say the transport-level retry must be zero on *every*
path — platform and organization alike:

1. The gateway settles billing without checking whether the client is still
   connected (``controller/relay.go:583``: ``if taskErr == nil { SettleBilling(...) }``
   with no ctx test). A read timeout on our side therefore says nothing about
   whether the upstream call was billed. The client-gone signal
   (``StreamEndReasonClientGone``) reaches only log generation
   (``service/log_info_generate.go:133``), never the billing path.
2. So a blind re-send after a timeout is not a *probable* double-charge, it is
   a *definite* one: two full relays, two settles.
3. The relay path honours no client-supplied idempotency key — request ids are
   server-generated (``middleware/request-id.go:10``), and the only
   ``X-Idempotency-Key`` in that repo is outbound to a payment provider. Both
   open alignment branches (rc.22, rc.24) leave this unchanged, so there is no
   near-term escape hatch.
4. The retry we actually want already exists one hop up: the gateway retries
   across channels *inside a single BillingSession* (one request id, one
   pre-consume, one settle), so it cannot double-bill. Production runs it —
   24h of ``claymore-llm-gateway-prod``: 3726 pre-consumes, 34 retries, chains
   up to 6 attempts.

The SDK's own default is 2, so ``max_retries=0`` has to be passed explicitly;
deleting that argument silently restores retries. That is what these tests
pin. An earlier round of review proposed a ``组织 0 / 直营 1`` split; it was
retracted (dramaclaw/dramaclaw#274, 2026-08-11) because fact 1 makes the
platform path no safer than the organization path — same gateway, same settle.
